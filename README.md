BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING DATA STRUCTURES(HASHMAP)

The Bank Management System is a console-based Java application designed to manage customer accounts and perform basic banking operations such as adding new customers, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. 

Utilizing object-oriented principles, the system is structured around three main classes: Customer, Bank, and BankManagementSystem.

-->The Customer class represents individual bank customers with attributes for name, account number, and balance, and methods for depositing and withdrawing money and managing loans. 
-->The Bank class manages multiple customers using a HashMap to store customer details and provides methods to add customers, handle transactions, and display balances. 
-->The BankManagementSystem class provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the system.
 The project aims to demonstrate the practical use of Java and data structures in creating a simple, functional banking application. 
 Users can perform operations like adding customers, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking account balances through a user-friendly menu-driven interface. 
 The system ensures that each account number is unique and handles basic validation for transactions
